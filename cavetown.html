    <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 whitespace-pre-line dark:text-gray-100">Recording artist Cavetown has recently come out as transgender due to the resurfacing of anti-semitic, racist, and transphobic posts.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">He has received backlash over these string of tweets, with many of his fans calling on him to explain his comments.

      Cavetown, whose real name Robin Skinner, has since released a lengthy statement on Twitter, apologising for each offensive remark he made. In the series of videos, he breaks down each post, taking accountability, explaining his mindset at the time and his sincere regret.
      
      When referencing his use of the transphobic slur “tr*nny,” the singer defends his right to say the word stating: “So another slur comes up in this, I said the word tr*nny. I’m just going to come out and say it. I’m transgender, so you may not have known that, but I am.”
      
      He then goes on to express his regret for using the word.
      
      “I don’t like the word, I don’t want to say it ever again,” he says. “I do acknowledge that for anyone who hasn’t figured out that I’m trans, it looks like I’m just a cis person who’s knowingly saying a slur, that they have no right to say, and that is really hurtful.”
      
      Closing out his apology he states that he’ll be “taking a break from the internet” to focus on educating himself and working with charities and organizations that centre around Jewish issues.</p>

              In 2016, Skinner released his second studio album, 16/04/16. The album includes a mix of "warm, melodic bedroom pop" and "lo-fi indie rock". The album was dedicated to his childhood friend, Jack Graham, who died of leukaemia on the album's titular date. 60% of the album's proceeds were donated to Cancer Research UK.

              In April 2017, whilst still at Sixth Form College, Skinner reached the final of the Cambridge Band Competition, winning both Best Acoustic Act and the Kimberley Rew Award for Songwriting, and went on to play at Strawberry Fair in June 2017. In 2018, he released his third album, Lemon Boy. As of November 2022, the album's title track has amassed 54 million streams on Spotify and 28 million views on YouTube.

                In 2019, Skinner released five split singles which were later compiled into Animal Kingdom, a mixtape of ten tracks including covers and original singles with guest appearances from Sidney Gish, Simi, Chloe Moriondo and Spookyghostboy. He produced the single "Prom Dress" by Mxmtoon, which has gained over 152 million streams on Spotify and has been used in over 100,000 videos on the video-sharing platform TikTok. The single was featured on Mxmtoon's debut album The Masquerade, which was also fully produced by Skinner. Skinner performed on the Acoustic Stage at Victorious Festival in August 2019. He signed under Sire Records in 2019 where he released the single "Telescope" ahead of his upcoming album, later announced as Sleepyhead. Skinner embarked on a series of sold-out worldwide headlining tours in October 2019. He played on tour at 31 venues in the US and 15 venues in the UK over the space of four months. He was joined by Hunny and Mxmtoon for a few shows in the UK tour, as well as Field Medic and Chloe Moriondo for a few shows in the US tour. In October 2019, Skinner announced his headlining tour along Australia's east coast, which took place in January 2020, where he was accompanied by Spookyghostboy.

                In 2020, Skinner released his major label debut album Sleepyhead, and appeared on the Recording Academy's Sessions series in support of MusiCares. He cancelled the tour in support of Sleepyhead due to the COVID-19 pandemic in June 2020. In July 2020, Skinner collaborated with Tessa Violet on the single "Smoke Signals" and announced the launch of his unisex clothing line Cave Collective.

                In June 2021, he released his extended play Man's Best Friend.
